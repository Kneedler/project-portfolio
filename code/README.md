# portfolio

This project was about to create a portfolio following a strict design using HTML and CSS .

# The problem

I had a lot of problems this week, with photos, responsiveness and other things that has not been a problem before. I found it challenging to follow a design like this when you don't have a base code. But it has also been educacional, and a good practice for the future.

The site is responsive, and works on different media platforms. The HTML has been run through a validation tool with good results. And also run through Wave for accessibility.

If I had more time, I would go over the design more and make small adjustments. Also adding OG:tags.
